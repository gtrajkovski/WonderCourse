# Course Builder Studio v2.0 Ideas

*Planning document for next major version*

## Vision

v2.0 focuses on **adaptive learning** and **content intelligence** - making courses that adapt to different learners and provide multiple pathways through material.

---

## Feature Categories

### 1. Intelligence Suite (Major)

#### 1.1 UDL Menus (Universal Design for Learning)
Offer content in multiple representations to support diverse learners.

**Concept:**
- Each activity can have multiple content variants
- Learners choose their preferred representation
- Same learning outcome, different delivery

**Content Variants:**
| Primary | Alternatives |
|---------|--------------|
| Video lecture | Audio-only, Transcript, Illustrated summary |
| Reading | Audio narration, Video explanation, Infographic |
| HOL activity | Guided walkthrough, Challenge mode, Sandbox |
| Quiz | Self-check, Peer discussion, Portfolio evidence |

**Implementation Ideas:**
- `ContentVariant` model linked to Activity
- Variant generator that creates alternatives from primary content
- UI toggle for "UDL Mode" showing variant options
- Analytics on variant preferences

#### 1.2 Depth Layers
Content at different complexity levels within the same course structure.

**Concept:**
- Three depth levels: Essential, Standard, Advanced
- Learners can "go deeper" or "simplify" at any point
- Same structure, different detail density

**Depth Definitions:**
| Level | Target | Content Style |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Essential | Time-constrained, overview seekers | Key points only, minimal examples |
| Standard | Default learning path | Full explanations, 2-3 examples |
| Advanced | Deep divers, experts | Extended theory, edge cases, research links |

**Implementation Ideas:**
- `depth_level` field on generated content
- Generator parameter for target depth
- "Go Deeper" / "Simplify" buttons in preview
- Learner profile default depth preference

#### 1.3 Inquiry Arcs
Guided discovery learning paths that build curiosity.

**Concept:**
- Structure content around questions, not just topics
- Each module poses a driving question
- Activities reveal answers through exploration

**Arc Structure:**
1. **Hook Question** - Provocative opener that creates curiosity
2. **Investigation** - Activities that explore facets of the question
3. **Discovery** - Key insights emerge from investigation
4. **Application** - Apply discoveries to new contexts
5. **Reflection** - What did we learn? What new questions arise?

**Implementation Ideas:**
- `InquiryArc` model with driving_question, investigation_activities, discoveries
- Arc-aware blueprint generator
- Visual arc progress indicator
- Question-based navigation mode

- Retry opportunities with varied questions
- Unlock next content only after mastery

#### 2.3 Remediation Paths
Automatic support when learners struggle.

**Features:**
- Detect low quiz scores or repeated failures
- Offer simplified explanations or additional examples
- Link to prerequisite content for review

**Services to Consider:**
- HeyGen (AI avatars)
- Synthesia (AI presenters)
- D-ID (talking head)

**Features:**
- Script to video conversion
- Avatar/presenter selection
- Slide integration
- Voiceover synthesis

#### 3.3 Interactive Simulations
Embedded interactive content beyond HOL.

**Types:**
- Code playgrounds (Python, SQL, etc.)
- Drag-and-drop exercises
- Branching scenarios
- Virtual labs

---

### 4. Collaboration & Review (Medium)

#### 4.1 SME Review Workflow
Structured subject matter expert review process.

**Features:**
- Assign reviewers to content sections
- Comment threads with resolution tracking
- Approval gates before publishing
- Review dashboard with pending items

#### 4.2 Version Comparison
Side-by-side content version comparison.

**Features:**
- Diff view for content changes
- Revert to previous versions
- Change history timeline
- Annotation on changes

#### 4.3 Team Templates
Shared templates across team members.

**Features:**
- Organization-level standards profiles
- Shared learner profiles
- Template library for common course structures
- Import/export template packs

---

### 5. Analytics & Insights (Medium)

#### 5.1 Content Quality Scoring
Automated quality assessment beyond current audit.

**Metrics:**
- Readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
- Engagement prediction
- Accessibility compliance
- SEO optimization (for public courses)

#### 5.2 Generation Analytics
Track AI generation patterns and costs.

**Features:**
- Token usage per course/activity

## Open Questions

1. **Scope**: Should v2.0 be one large release or multiple v2.x incremental releases?
2. **UDL Priority**: Which content variants are most valuable? (Audio seems high-value, low-effort)
3. **AI Media**: Self-hosted vs. API services? Cost implications?
4. **Adaptive Learning**: How much learner data do we want to store/track?
5. **Mobile**: Native app vs. PWA vs. responsive web?

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Content variants per activity | 2+ average |
| Depth layer coverage | 100% of text content |
| Inquiry arc adoption | 50% of new courses |
| AI image generation | < 30s per image |
| SME review cycle time | < 48 hours |
